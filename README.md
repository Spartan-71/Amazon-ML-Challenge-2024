## Problem Statement: Entity Extraction from Images for Digital Marketplaces

In this hackathon, the objective is to develop a machine learning model capable of extracting key entity values from images. This capability is crucial in industries like healthcare, e-commerce, and content moderation, where precise product information is vital as digital marketplaces expand.

The goal is to automate the extraction of critical product details, such as:

- **Weight**
- **Volume**
- **Voltage**
- **Dimensions**
- **And more...**

These values are essential for providing accurate and detailed product descriptions, improving the overall efficiency of digital stores. The model should effectively process images to extract this information, even when dealing with diverse layouts, text formats, and image quality.
